# Tunnel-Relay Manager

The Tunnel-Relay Manager (trmanager) turns your host into a managed gateway for solutions hosted elsewhere. 
The tool offers a friendly UI that allows the Administrator to establish a Tunnel to a remote system, without required command-line access to the gateway host. 

Features
* Friendly web-based UI that allows for creation of Connections, Local and Remote Forwards
* Generation of virtual-hosts for services that require local exposure via a CNAME (Apache support only at this time)
* Automatic tunnel re-initation when packets drop through AutoSSH
* Support for HTTP proxies (requiring Corkscrew)
* Status probing of tunnels
* Logging and Auditing
* Export of configurations

Requirements
* Apache2
* PHP5.3+ with libapache2-mod-php and mcrypt
* AutoSSH
* Corkscrew
* MySQL

# Installation
*Please follow all steps precisely to install and configure Tunnel-Relay Manager*
```
Install Apache
Install PHP + module mcrypt
Install libapache2-mod-php
Install AutoSSH
Install Corkscrew
Install MySQL
```

Apache:

```bash
Enable mod proxy (a2enmod proxy)
Enable mod proxy_http (a2enmod proxy_http)
Enable mod proxy_wstunnel (a2enmod proxy_wstunnel)
Enable mod rewrite (a2enmod rewrite)
```

# Configuration

## [ Setting up TRManager ] 
 1. Make sure editor/bin/start_agent.sh is executable
	```bash
	sudo chown www-data editor/bin/start_agent.sh 
	sudo chmod +x editor/bin/start_agent.sh 
	```
	
 2.	Import trmanager.sql into database 'trmanager' using command below
    ```bash
	mysql -u <username> -p trmanager < trmanager.sql
	```
 
 3. Adjust editor/conf/config.php to reflect correct DB parameters

## [ Virtual host administration ]
 1. Make sure www-data user Owns the sites-available directory so Virtual Hosts can be operated by trmanager
	
	```bash
	sudo chown www-data /etc/apache2/sites-available
	```

 2. Ensure www-data user (Apache user) can Reload Apache 
    
	Execute:
	```bash
	sudo visudo
	```

    Add the following*:
	```bash
	Cmnd_Alias      APACHE_RELOAD = /usr/sbin/service apache2 reload	
	Cmnd_Alias      APACHE_A2ENSITE = /usr/sbin/a2ensite	
	Cmnd_Alias      APACHE_A2DISSITE = /usr/sbin/a2dissite

	www-data ALL=NOPASSWD: APACHE_RELOAD	
	www-data ALL=NOPASSWD: APACHE_A2ENSITE
	www-data ALL=NOPASSWD: APACHE_A2DISSITE
	```
	

    * Please make sure Above Paths are EXACTLY correct using 'which' command to find out binary locations of a2ensite, a2dissite and service.
	
    * Same paths must also be specified in 'Settings' section in the Tunnel-Relay manager web-UI
  
  3. Edit default virtualhost (sites-available/default config)
  
  	Set the name virtual host to the desired domain that will act as the jumphost. Configure a CNAME for where the tunnel relay manager will be active.

	Add/change the following at the top of the file:

	```bash
	  NameVirtualHost test.jumphost.com:80
	  <VirtualHost trmanager.test.jumphost.com:80>
	  ....
	```

  Reload Apache using 'service apache2 reload'
